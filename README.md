# 📜 Decentralized Copyrights Management System

Welcome to the Decentralized Copyrights Management System! This DApp allows users to register and view copyrights for their products or services on the blockchain, leveraging the power of blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and efficient copyright management.

## 🚀 Features

- **Immutable Record Keeping:** Secure and tamper-proof copyright registrations using blockchain technology.
- **Decentralization:** Enhanced security and resilience through a decentralized architecture.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automated and transparent copyright registration and transfer processes.
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and transaction signing with MetaMask.
- **Transparency and Trust:** Complete transparency in transactions, allowing independent verification.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Immediate notifications of changes and updates.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive design for easy navigation and use.
- **Scalability:** Built to handle increased demand and a growing user base.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### User Authentication

1. Users connect their Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask) to the DApp.
2. The DApp retrieves the user's Ethereum account and network information.

### Smart Contract Interaction

1. The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum network (Linea Sepolia in this case).
2. The DApp interacts with the smart contract to:
   - Register new copyrights
   - Transfer ownership
   - Fetch registered copyrights

### Displaying Data

1. The DApp displays all registered copyrights and the user's registered copyrights.
2. Users can search and filter the list of registered copyrights.
